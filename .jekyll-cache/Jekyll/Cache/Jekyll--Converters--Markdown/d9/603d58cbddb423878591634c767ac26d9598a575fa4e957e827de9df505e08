I"Ò<p>Hey! ğŸ‘‹ğŸ¼ Youâ€™ve somehow found your way to my small corner of the internet. Hooray!</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a software engineer and artist. Here youâ€™ll find a mix of writing and art â€“
links to music Iâ€™ve put into the world, ramblings on books Iâ€™ve read, notes
on different film processes Iâ€™ve experimented with and corresponding photos, etc.</p>

<p>My perspectives are undoubtedly framed by my experiences being mixed-race,
transgender, part of the Chinese-Malaysia diaspora, and brought up in a lot of different
places, from Knoxville, Tennessee to Singapore and many in between.</p>

<p>In art &amp; life, I think often of masculinity/femininity, queerness, â€œhomeâ€, cultural legacies &amp; practices, relationships, and boundaries.</p>

<p>I like to <a href="https://makzai.bandcamp.com">make</a> <a href="https://bit.ly/qleong-bandcamp/album/young">music</a> / take <a href="https://vsco.co/qleong">photos</a> /
write <a href="http://qleong.com/assets/writing/slantd.pdf">essays</a> / make
<a href="http://qleong.com/2018-review/">things on the internet</a>.</p>

<p>I love being an introvert, and a virgo, and can usually be found in Oakland, CA.</p>
