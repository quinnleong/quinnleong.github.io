<p>This was a really sweet graphic novel. It covers a lot of the authorâ€™s (e/em/eir pronouns) experiences coming into
eir identities, showing both a deepening in eir own relationship to eirself and the ways that those identities
have showed up in eir relationships with others.</p>

<p>I thought the art was really beautiful, and while e hopped around a bit and covered so much ground throughout
eir life, it didnâ€™t feel very disjointed â€“ there was definitely a thread running throughout the book connecting
everything. I also liked that e didnâ€™t try to wrap everything up neatly with a bow â€“ e left some questions, like
how e wants to navigate eir gender identity in professional spaces, unanswered, true to eir experiences of still
living those questions.</p>

<p>One piece that felt lacking to me was any mention of race. The book was very much framed around the identities
and experiences that presented challenges and/or required questioning and navigating for the author; obviously I canâ€™t know
everything about the authorâ€™s life, but based on what was covered in the book, it seemed like race just wasnâ€™t one of those.
E describes growing up as a white person in California, so this isnâ€™t super surprising to me. But I think itâ€™s
impossible to talk about gender without also talking about race, and the not-mentioning of race in eir discussion of
gender is implicitly about whiteness; the ability to navigate oneâ€™s gender and body without having to think through
how itâ€™s mediated by race is a mark of whiteness, fundamentally.</p>

<p>That said, itâ€™s still a good read. I think the personal nature of the narrative makes it accessible to a lot of folks,
even people who may not have known any gender queer people before or even known that term. It shouldnâ€™t be a requirement, but
I do appreciate that the personal nature of eirâ€™s story as itâ€™s told here â€“ the specificity of eir own experiences â€“Â helps resist
any tendency that readers might have to take this one narrative as representative of every gender queer personâ€™s life and
experiences.</p>
