<p>Inject Jia Tolentinoâ€™s thoughts straight into my veins in real-time.</p>

<p>These are just outstanding essays, on such wide-ranging topics. Her ability to pull together so many disparate threads
and suddenly alchemize them in a way I couldnâ€™t see coming never stopped surprising me throughout this book.</p>

<p>I love that she trains her keen and connective eye on so many different cultural touch points: the internet,
reality TV, the institution of marriage, universitiesâ€™ handlings of sexual assault, barre classes â€“ the list goes on.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m impatiently awaiting her next book, honestly.</p>
