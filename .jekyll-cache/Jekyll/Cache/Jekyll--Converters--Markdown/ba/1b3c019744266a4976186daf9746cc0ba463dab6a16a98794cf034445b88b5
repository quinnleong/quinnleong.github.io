<div class="film-description">
This film tells the stories of a few women in France and how their lives intertwine during a
specific period of time. It's set during the 19th century, and the women span different
class backgrounds. The central focal point of the plot is one woman being tasked to paint
a portrait of another, and a lot of complexity and conflict that originates from that job.
I can't say much more here without giving a lot away.

<p>This is one of my favorite films of all time. It’s such a deeply moving story, told in
such a beautiful and heartbreaking way. It portrays the lives and decisions and compromises
and relationships of women in such amazing detail and specificity, and is just such
a beautifully-written story that will also break your heart.</p>

<p>I really loved how quiet the film was. There was no gratuitous soundtrack to fill the silences;
it was a lot of mise-en-scene audio, and the bareness felt very appropriate and really
kept me present in the setting and in the spaces between. It’s also just a beautiful film
visually. The setting couldn’t be more beautiful, and there are so many lovely images.</p>

<p>I thought the way men were absent except for the very beginning and end was particularly impactful.
It’s so rare to spend the vast majority of a film purely in the presence of women, and
it truly felt so jarringly noticeable to have a man’s presence at the end.</p>
