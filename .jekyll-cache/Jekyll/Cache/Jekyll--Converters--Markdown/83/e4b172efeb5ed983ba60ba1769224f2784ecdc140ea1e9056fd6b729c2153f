<p><em>Sigh</em>. I really, really thought I was going to love this book, 5/5, recommend it to all my friends.
In fact, I actually DID recommend it to my best friend as a book for us to read together, after listening
to an interview with Aminatou Sow, before Iâ€™d even cracked the cover. Sadly, it really didnâ€™t live up to
my expectations â€“ not even close.</p>

<p>This book was a disappointment for many reasons. First and foremost, itâ€™s not actually a book about friendship
and its role, culturally and socially, told through the memories and anecdotes of this pairâ€™s friendship. Iâ€™d
say itâ€™s actually the inverse, the story of <em>this specific pairâ€™s friendship</em>  with small crumbs of
socio-cultural insights about friendships thrown in briefly every 30-50 pages, while the spotlight continually
jumps back to the two authors. From all of the marketing materials, I thought the â€œweâ€ in the subtitle â€œHow
We Keep Each Other Closeâ€ was we, as in, humans; after reading it, I can only conclude that they literally meant
we, the authors.</p>

<p>Which brings me to disappointment reason #2: the whole books feels like an over-extended marketing blurb
cum personal branding exercise. The tone of voice takes on the same quality as a Bustle article, with snippets
like â€œThatâ€™s why goddess created the cervix!â€ thrown in. That paired with their many trademarked phrases
(shine theory! desert ladies getaway! friendweb!) made it feel like a branding study.</p>

<p>And, relatedly, the third reason I struggled with this book was that the authors chose to tell the story
in plural first person, as a collective unit. This means that generally the writing is phrased as â€œweâ€ and â€œusâ€, but
it constantly switches back and forth to third person wherever their narrative or experiences deviate, creating a
continual bobbing back and forth between the strange and falsely-cheery feeling collective voice of â€œweâ€/â€usâ€ and
the distanced language of that first-person narrator suddenly referring to herself in the third person â€“ itâ€™s jarring!
One moment, theyâ€™re saying â€œWe loved it!â€, and the next â€œAminatou felt sad.â€ I think this strange combination of
the collective first-person plural and removed third-person singular is a huge contributing factor to the marketing copy
feeling of the prose â€“Â itâ€™s like a weird mash-up of company-speak, where the company refers to itself as a collective
unit presenting a unified face, and the distanced professionalism of a third-person speaker bio in a conference pamphlet.</p>

<p>The few and far-between flashes of insights and research from interviews they had done were enough to just start to be
interesting â€“ they were just way too limited (weâ€™re talking maybe a few sentences per snippet, if that) to provide any
satisfaction. If youâ€™re someone who remotely cares about the role of friendships in modern life and society (and Iâ€™m
guessing you probably are, if youâ€™ve thought of picking up this book), thereâ€™s nothing much new to find, because the depthÂ of
whatâ€™s shared from the research is just so shallow.</p>

<p>All of this criticism aside, I also have to say that I genuinely enjoyed reading the book. Itâ€™s a catchy tale of
two friends who are smart and funny, and theyâ€™re both good writers. And letâ€™s be honest, who doesnâ€™t enjoy getting a
little window into the inner workings and gossip of someone elseâ€™s relationships? This would probably be a lot more
exciting, too, if I had been a long-time listener of their podcast, which Iâ€™ve actually never listened to before. I
wouldnâ€™t recommend it for the expectations I had going in, but as a fun and light memoir, it could be a solid choice.</p>
