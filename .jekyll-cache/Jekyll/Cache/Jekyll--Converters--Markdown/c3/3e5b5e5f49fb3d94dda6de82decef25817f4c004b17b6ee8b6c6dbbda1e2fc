<p>1.5 stars, really. This book was… a journey.</p>

<p>One GoodReads reviewer summed it up perfectly: “I guess I just don’t think the things P. Carl has to say about masculinity are as interesting as P. Carl thinks they are.”</p>

<p>Overall, the book started off terribly, but I begrudgingly enjoyed the middle and end. The first few chapters are just rife with
toxic masculinity, over-done bravado, and harmful statements said with… well, the confidence of a white man. I don’t think I’ve ever
rolled my eyes so many times while reading a book, and that was only in the first 30 pages.</p>

<p>Part of the problem is that he tries to dramatize everything, and ends up making harmful statements that even he doesn’t believe,
as evidenced by his later more-nuanced writing, just for the sake of making a spectacle for the reader. For example, he’ll
later talk about how his journey to identifying as a man unfolded over time; meanwhile, on page two, he describes an experience of being
called sir in a hotel lobby, about which he says, “On March 16, 2017, I become a man. What changed from yesterday and the day
before yesterday? What is this fine line of gender that makes me a woman one day and a man the next? Did my jawline get just square
enough, my voice deep enough?” He makes a number of these harmful and simply inaccurate statements that reinforce the misconception that one’s voice
pitch, appearance, or ability to be sir’d or maam’d by strangers make a person’s gender.</p>

<p>In that same opening chapter, he also “borrows” W.E.B. Dubois’ term “double consciousness”, with all its racial context, and twists its meaning for his own purposes. Four pages
later, he defines the term “boi” incorrectly, ignoring its roots in queer and trans communities of color (especially Black transmasculine spaces),
and misrepresents many people’s experiences with their own gender expressions and identities by saying unequivocally, “Butches and bois aren’t men,
they are queer women.” In reality, many people consider “butch” to be their gender, full stop, and don’t identify as women. I guess it somehow feels
disgustingly appropriate for a straight white man to be speaking on behalf of people whose experiences aren’t his own with such confidence and universality,
and getting it completely wrong.</p>

<p>I’m also just confused as to how this book made it past an editor. From basic syntactical errors like “a women’s terror”, to this nonsensical analogy:
“I am like a newborn who is expected to drive sixty-five miles per hour down the highway, but I can’t see above the steering wheel. I crane my neck upward
to get a glimpse of wholeness in the rearview mirror and weep with relief at that gorgeous gray-haired man. I want to believe that my past is behind me, that
I will look at him forever, that we are undivided.” So… his past is behind him, but also his future self is in the rear view mirror with his current
infant body driving away from that future self at 65 MPH…?</p>

<p>Forty pages later, I have to laugh out loud; he’s just announced un-self-consciously, that he chose to get the Kanji character (which he mistakenly calls
a symbol) for SOLDIER tattooed on his wrist. He then goes on to explain for multiple pages that his experiences being trans
and dealing with trauma to self-actualize are the same as war veterans in the trenches. I can respect that he has gone through an unspeakable amount of pain and trauma
to get where he is today – and I also can’t ignore the irony of him becoming this exact caricature of a man fixated on embodying masculinity in all of its
stereotypical forms. He’s now a white dude, obsessed with war and battle. Lest you think I’m exaggerating: “The only reality that my body can fully connect
to is steeped in western showdowns at sunset, the beaches at Normandy in World War II…” He’ll later criticize another white man on a group mountaineering trip
for his misplaced bravado and for over-selling how rugged and experienced he is with outdoor adventures. And yet, somehow none of that irony or awareness applies
to his own bravado in viewing himself as a soldier of war.</p>

<p>While reading, I can’t escape the fact that his gender has become his entire world, his entire frame. He says, “My happiness, my pleasure, my desire,
my work, and my hobbies are connected to my maleness and my masculinity.” It gives me pause and makes me question whether one can ethically participate in
gendered rituals and norms. Is doing so not upholding a system of gender that will always marginalize and oppress some people to the benefit of others?
I can’t help but notice, in his description of the easy and casual camaraderie he now has with men in public, that it’s white men who call him “man” or “bro”,
who chat him up in a hotel parking lot or a bar while they both ignore their wives. I know for certain that the older white men he has these encounters with
don’t do this with me. Even if it’s not made explicit, these interactions are fundamentally about sameness – about whiteness, about
heterosexuality, about patriarchy.</p>

<p>Even as he’s undoing the gendered trauma he’s experienced, he’s propping up forms of masculinity that are hegemonic and violent, in ways either subtle or overt. In one
horrifying story, he describes his interaction with a Lyft driver who’s complaining about “his woman” and how women “only want your money”; instead of
calling this man out, or even simply staying silent or responding noncommittally, he adds his own misogynistic fuel to the fire: “Yeah, man, I feel you. My
wife hasn’t worked in like ten years, all that bullshit about women’s rights.” The worst part is that he seems to own this behavior and see no issue with it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“I tip him ten dollars and give him five stars for letting me indulge my inner asshole. That guy that I have been trained so well in replicating. I don’t beat myself
up about these exchanges. My friend Lee tells me it’s my job to correct this behavior, and sometimes I do, but sometimes I dive right in, trying to grasp at some
false sense of power that I know has been used against me a thousand times in another life.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He says this with no self-consciousnes or self-critism, only pages after describing his rage
at all of the mistreatment, unfairness, and casual sexism he experienced in his 20+ years of working and living as a woman.
Even in the acknowledgements at the very end of the book, he can’t thank his best friend, also a trans man, without making limiting judgments about what
being a man means for “every guy”, not just for himself: “Every guy needs a couple of buddies to hike with and drink beer with and talk sneakers with.”
Has he still not realized that, actually, not all men are hiking, beer-drinking bros, who <em>want</em> to participate in active toxic misogyny towards the women
in their lives? In one breath, he complains about how the prescriptions of womanhood never fit him; in another, he upholds this singular idea of what makes a man.</p>

<p>I would be remiss not to admit that there were also many parts in the middle of the book that were more nuanced and meaningful to read, and which make
up the bulk of the book by volume – his expression of anger and hurt at
never having encountered a doctor or therapist, in his 50+ years of life, in and out of therapy and mental institutions, who had thought to
ask whether gender might be a part of his pain; his discussion of RuPaul and trans women drag queens, about what makes gender a performance versus a thing
actually “achieved” or lived; some wrestlings with how to reconcile that the gender binary has been harmful to him yet feels good for him now;
his anecdotes about encounters with old family friends during his father’s health decline who ask where his sister (his “former” self) is; and his realization
that he had not even been privy to all the things society had denied him as a woman until he could see it from the inside, as a man welcomed among men.</p>

<p>But it’s also hard to take in these meaningful parts entirely, when I can’t stop picturing this white man with a Japanese character for SOLDIER tattooed on his wrist,
bumping fists with other men in a bar and talking shit about “his woman”. In the end, yes, we’re all swimming in this mess; none of us are immune from internalizing
the terrible cultural messaging we constantly encounter. But it’s still our responsibility to unpack and unlearn it. He doesn’t get a free pass to
be a sexist man because it’s taken him 50 years to get there. There’s no righteousness in wielding the same power that was once weaponized against you. You just become
the monster.</p>
