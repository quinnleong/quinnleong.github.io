The pandemic has been a good opportunity to continue my home experiments with developing B&W film
with Rodinal. It's great being able to easily and immediately develop a single roll of film the same
night that I finish shooting it. Rodinal also has a long shelf-life, so it's great for my slow
shooting during the pandemic.

I will say, quarantining has definitely made finding inspiring photo subjects a bit challenging,
but I've appreciated the challenge and the push to look at familiar places with renewed curiosity.
It's also been a nice opportunity to really build a relationship with the same space over time; I've been
coming back to the same building or the same bench on my near-daily walks over and over,
watching how the light changes subtly with the shortening days or how my own perception changes with
familiarity. I've often been surprised at how I still find new ways to view and shoot the same
place, even after six-plus months of walking the same path.

I've also been learning my scanner in this time. With that, I am able to do the full process in-house,
so to speak, from shooting the film, to developing it, to scanning it in to my computer, to doing any
post-processing. I may eventually transition to VueScan, since it seems to offer better control than
the software that comes bundled with the Epson scanner, but for my current skills, the Epson software
is getting the job done.

## Stand Development

So far, I've mostly been experimenting with semi-stand development. This has been fun, and not to mention
easy to do in the background while cooking or watching TV or even during the work day. I fill the tank, do
my initial agitations, and then leave it on the counter until my timer goes off to do a couple more agitations.

I've played a little with the frequency of agitations, and found that just doing a couple of agitations
at the half-hour mark is plenty to prevent any edge effects or haloing, at least in the rolls I've done so far.
I was doing every fifteen minutes, but from what I've read, less agitation helps control the grain, so I'm
happy with just the one mid-point agitation. However, the negatives have turned out a bit flatter than I'd like, so I'm going
to switch over to traditional development for the next few rolls at least, and see if the contrast is more to my taste.
I have a feeling that there's just an inevitable trade-off between grain tightness and contrast with Rodinal,
but I want to play it out.

There are a lot of strong opinions about using (or rather, NOT using) Rodinal with HP5 film or for pushing,
but from the examples I see on [filmdev.org](https://filmdev.org/recipe/finder/?find=hp5+in+rodinal),
I quite like the combination, even for pushed HP5! Right now I have two rolls
of HP5 going, one at box speed in my Canonet QL-17 GIII, and the other at 1600 in my Ricoh 500GX.
The Ricoh is currently untested, so this is also a test roll for that camera (I can tell the shutter is operating
correctly, so am mostly unsure about the aperture control and any light leaks – we'll see!). I plan to develop
both of those at either the standard 1:25 or 1:50 and go from there.

Anyway, without further ado, here are some example frames from the stand-developed rolls. These are unedited, straight from scanner.

A big caveat: these are difficult to compare directly, because the first roll is Kentmere 100, and the second is Kentmere 400. However,
the fact that the 400 looks about the same or even less grainy to me (depending on which shot), despite being a higher speed film, suggests that the grain
tightness was in fact improved by the reduced agitation. Once I get a thermometer and can control the other variables better,
I might do another test that's more rigorous.

## 15-Minute Agitation Cycles

These first three are from the stand development where I agitated every fiften minutes. They're a bit too
grainy and gritty for my taste, so I would call these over-agitated.

## 30-Minute Agitation Cycle

These next three are from the batch where I agitated only a couple of times at the half-hour mark, and the grain looks
either similar (despite the higher speed) or smoother to me, especially on 1 and 3. This is definitely a good style
for my preferences, so I'll be curious to see if the traditional development gives a result I like as much.

I honestly still like the one Xtol batch I did better than any of the results I've gotten from Rodinal so far,
but Xtol is more expensive and has a much shorter shelf-life. It also requires a lot more storage space since
it's pre-mixed into a huge batch. So for now, I'm sticking with Rodinal and seeing how tightly I can dial in
a style I like a lot. I actually do have some Xtol that's technically expired, so I might try a mixture next
and just see what happens I've seen a recipe that's 1 part Xtol to 4 parts water, plus the usual amount of Rodinal,
so I'll probably give that a go. I also want to try slightly cooler temps, as I've seen multiple people mention
that helps control grain too. I've been without a thermometer so far, so my temperature control has been pretty
bad and I think skewed too hot thus far. In other words, lots of experimenting yet to come!
