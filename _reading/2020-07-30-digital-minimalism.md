So, first a confession, which is that I haven't finished this book. But I'm writing about it
now because, at this point, I doubt I will finish it.

The ideas in it are good overall. But they're also the kind of thing you've probably already
thought about in-depth if you've ever spent more than five minutes considering how you might
reduce your dependence on your phone, social media, etc. or cultivate a more intentional relationship
to technology.

He opens by talking about how some people in his life expressed confusion on how he could
write this kind of book, never having used social media, to which he responds that that's exactly
why he's uniquely poised to write about it well. I call BS. He's writing about how to break emotional
dependencies that he's never experienced.

I'm throwing this one on top of the pile of other "reduce your technology/social media addiction" books that
I've tossed aside â€“ in all of them, it seems like there's a lot more depth possible, but they stay resolutely
on the surface.

That said, his writing is clear (albeit a bit long-winded and at times self-righteous), and I've heard
good things about his other books, so I'll probably give Deep Work a chance at some point.
