Inject Jia Tolentino's thoughts straight into my veins in real-time.

These are just outstanding essays, on such wide-ranging topics. Her ability to pull together so many disparate threads
and suddenly alchemize them in a way I couldn't see coming never stopped surprising me throughout this book.

I love that she trains her keen and connective eye on so many different cultural touch points: the internet,
reality TV, the institution of marriage, universities' handlings of sexual assault, barre classes â€“ the list goes on.

I'm impatiently awaiting her next book, honestly.
