This was a really sweet graphic novel. It covers a lot of the author's (e/em/eir pronouns) experiences coming into
eir identities, showing both a deepening in eir own relationship to eirself and the ways that those identities
have showed up in eir relationships with others.

I thought the art was really beautiful, and while e hopped around a bit and covered so much ground throughout
eir life, it didn't feel very disjointed – there was definitely a thread running throughout the book connecting
everything. I also liked that e didn't try to wrap everything up neatly with a bow – e left some questions, like
how e wants to navigate eir gender identity in professional spaces, unanswered, true to eir experiences of still
living those questions.

One piece that felt lacking to me was any mention of race. The book was very much framed around the identities
and experiences that presented challenges and/or required questioning and navigating for the author; obviously I can't know
everything about the author's life, but based on what was covered in the book, it seemed like race just wasn't one of those.
E describes growing up as a white person in California, so this isn't super surprising to me. But I think it's
impossible to talk about gender without also talking about race, and the not-mentioning of race in eir discussion of
gender is implicitly about whiteness; the ability to navigate one's gender and body without having to think through
how it's mediated by race is a mark of whiteness, fundamentally.

That said, it's still a good read. I think the personal nature of the narrative makes it accessible to a lot of folks,
even people who may not have known any gender queer people before or even known that term. It shouldn't be a requirement, but
I do appreciate that the personal nature of eir's story as it's told here – the specificity of eir own experiences – helps resist
any tendency that readers might have to take this one narrative as representative of every gender queer person's life and
experiences.
