_Sigh_. I really, really thought I was going to love this book, 5/5, recommend it to all my friends.
In fact, I actually DID recommend it to my best friend as a book for us to read together, after listening
to an interview with Aminatou Sow, before I'd even cracked the cover. Sadly, it really didn't live up to
my expectations – not even close.

This book was a disappointment for many reasons. First and foremost, it's not actually a book about friendship
and its role, culturally and socially, told through the memories and anecdotes of this pair's friendship. I'd
say it's actually the inverse, the story of _this specific pair's friendship_  with small crumbs of
socio-cultural insights about friendships thrown in briefly every 30-50 pages, while the spotlight continually
jumps back to the two authors. From all of the marketing materials, I thought the "we" in the subtitle "How
We Keep Each Other Close" was we, as in, humans; after reading it, I can only conclude that they literally meant
we, the authors.

Which brings me to disappointment reason #2: the whole books feels like an over-extended marketing blurb
cum personal branding exercise. The tone of voice takes on the same quality as a Bustle article, with snippets
like "That's why goddess created the cervix!" thrown in. That paired with their many trademarked phrases
(shine theory! desert ladies getaway! friendweb!) made it feel like a branding study.

And, relatedly, the third reason I struggled with this book was that the authors chose to tell the story
in plural first person, as a collective unit. This means that generally the writing is phrased as "we" and "us", but
it constantly switches back and forth to third person wherever their narrative or experiences deviate, creating a
continual bobbing back and forth between the strange and falsely-cheery feeling collective voice of "we"/"us" and
the distanced language of that first-person narrator suddenly referring to herself in the third person – it's jarring!
One moment, they're saying "We loved it!", and the next "Aminatou felt sad." I think this strange combination of
the collective first-person plural and removed third-person singular is a huge contributing factor to the marketing copy
feeling of the prose – it's like a weird mash-up of company-speak, where the company refers to itself as a collective
unit presenting a unified face, and the distanced professionalism of a third-person speaker bio in a conference pamphlet.

The few and far-between flashes of insights and research from interviews they had done were enough to just start to be
interesting – they were just way too limited (we're talking maybe a few sentences per snippet, if that) to provide any
satisfaction. If you're someone who remotely cares about the role of friendships in modern life and society (and I'm
guessing you probably are, if you've thought of picking up this book), there's nothing much new to find, because the depth of
what's shared from the research is just so shallow.

All of this criticism aside, I also have to say that I genuinely enjoyed reading the book. It's a catchy tale of
two friends who are smart and funny, and they're both good writers. And let's be honest, who doesn't enjoy getting a
little window into the inner workings and gossip of someone else's relationships? This would probably be a lot more
exciting, too, if I had been a long-time listener of their podcast, which I've actually never listened to before. I
wouldn't recommend it for the expectations I had going in, but as a fun and light memoir, it could be a solid choice.
