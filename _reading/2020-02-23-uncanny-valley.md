This is a spot on, incisive memoir of diving into the tech industry in SF with no
expectations, nor context to anticipate the absurdity awaiting.

Deeply comical and horrifying in equal measures.
I found the narration style very dead-pan, and I think this
made the writing hit harder than any cerebral or verbose critique would.
Both the comedy and the critique come from her simply describing things
in blunt terms, as they actually are, no additional commentary necessary.

One tech worker reviewed it as two stars out of five, saying he didn't find much
in her observations and critiques, that it was "thin, uninteresting, and commonplace".
To me, this feels like when I lived in Portland and I'd hear people around the city say,
"I don't get the show Portlandia. The jokes aren't even funny." The 'making strange' of
things that so many of us just take for granted, working in the tech industry, is the crowning
achievement of this book.

I would recommend this book to those interested in the cultural aspects of start-ups,
hoping to both laugh and cringe, or simply looking for a solid memoir.

Of it, Jia Tolentino says, "I wonâ€™t be alone in returning to it for clarity and consolation for many years to come."
Same here.
