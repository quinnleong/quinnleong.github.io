A thoughtful look at masculinity â€“ in particular, how many men connect through sport as a way to make up for
missing intimacy and touch due to living inside of "the man box", whether through their own behavioral choices or
through the limits on interactions others expect or allow from them. I really appreciated McBee's candor about
how his own relationships, both with individuals and with the world at large, shifted, and all of the deeper questions
that came out of those shifts. He is so skilled at blending beautiful memoir writing with approachable analysis
of social systems and norms, which I also felt in his debut book, Man Alive.

Four stars instead of five because I just wish it had gone a little deeper.
