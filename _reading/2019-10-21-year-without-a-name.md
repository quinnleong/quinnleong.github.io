I have a lot of mixed feelings about this one. Ultimately, it's a good read
and I will probably read it again at some point. But I had some issues with it too.

My biggest qualm was that the author ruminates on fame intensely, yet never addresses the fact
that this book was seemingly published based entirely on it (they don't seem to have any
online author presence or previous writing experience, yet they describe getting this publishing deal –
and paid for it – without any manuscript to show). I can definitely see how growing up with
the spotlight always roaming near you would really affect your experiences just trying to live in
your own body and navigate your gender identity. But it seems remiss not to acknowledge
the flip side of it as well.

That said, I appreciated that the book was attempting to be true to their own
mental spirals, ruminations, self-loathing, etc. It wasn't a neatly-packaged narrative, and
it certainly wasn't trying to be. I think that makes it a much more direct representation
of their actual experiences, which is interesting to witness as a reader. But it was
rambly and what some might call self-indulgent in many places as a result too.

Ultimately, the book was very different from what I expected after reading the New Yorker excerpt.
That piece was a lot more poetic, polished, and clear. I can see the value in the lack of cohesion
and almost stream-of-consciousness of the book's style, but it did make for a very different
read than the excerpt implied, and I have to say I preferred the excerpt's style.

I don't want to say we live in an entirely zero-sum world, where every book that's published
by a relatively privileged author is at the expense of another story we're not reading from a less
relatively privileged author – I don't think it neatly maps into this one-for-one trade, nor do I think
this book and the author's experiences can be reduced to being only about privilege. It's a lot more complicated
than that. But it's also impossible to ignore the fact that this white, fame-adjacent (hello, Lena Dunham),
wealthy person got a book deal, with seemingly no experience, to tell their own personal narrative when there
is such a dearth of stories from trans people, especially who aren't also white, wealthy, and with a lot of
access to resources. In other words, I'm very hesitant to frame this as a competition among the trans community,
and at the same time... We see a lot of white trans stories, and not a lot of other ones. On an individual
level, it's unfair to the author to say it's not meaningful or valid for them to write about their own experiences.
And on a systemic level, of course theirs is the "trans story" (ew, but also true) that gets the book deal.
