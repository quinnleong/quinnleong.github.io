title:  "Rio de Janeiro Espresso"
tagline: "Herbal & Sandalwood"
pods:  3
intensity: 9
taste: "Exotic and velvety, this all-Brazilian Arabica blend is partly dark roasted to enhance the body and bitterness needed for that cafezinho character.

A pleasantly bitter and velvety-textured cup with unexpected walnut, sandalwood and herbal notes reminiscent of thyme and rosemary."

notes: ["Nutty & Balanced"]
journal: "A bit dark and bitter for me, in a way that didn't feel as balanced out by the brightness of acidity as I would normally go for (makes sense, it's very low on acidity). The nuttiness definitely came through. Still enjoyed trying it though."
