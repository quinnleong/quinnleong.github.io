roaster_notes: "Milk & Honey is our most developed coffee. It is well structured, full bodied, syrupy-sweet and is designed to be complementary with milk. Flavor notes of dark chocolate and brown sugar pair with blueberry jam and toasted almond. Mild acidity, and a velvety body create a comforting, balanced cup. We enjoy this coffee as espresso and drip."
