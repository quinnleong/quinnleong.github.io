roaster_notes: "This Colombian reveals a pleasant aroma of chocolate, lime and herbaceous quality. The first sip has an upfront lime flavor that cools to a clean lemon verbena quality. As the cup cools, this coffee reveals a nectarine flavor. For the aftertaste, there is a slight floral and sugar cane quality. This Washed Processed coffee offers a bright acidity and a smooth mouthfeel."
