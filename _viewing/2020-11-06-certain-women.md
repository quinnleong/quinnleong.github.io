<div class="film-description">
This film depicts three vignettes of women living in Montana, centered on the town of Livingston.
The three stories are told mostly separately, with only small unspoken background connections
loosely tying them together.

I think this honestly just became my new favorite film. It's so beautiful and melancholy. Many people
have taken issue with the slow pace and the lack of resolution, but I generally really enjoy
slow contemplative films and felt the realism conveyed through the lack of neat, happy endings
was more impactful. I was unsure whether the three stories would intertwine more deeply, but
I wasn't disappointed that the connections were only implicit. Nothing about this film felt
nearly packaged or resolved, and that seemed suitable to the subject matter and style. It was
just evoking a mood, an ache.

I've seen multiple reviewers describe Lily Gladstone as "luminous", and I absolutely have to
agree. All three stories were moving, but hers especially so, and I appreciated that the film closed
with her.

Definitely will be coming back to rewatch this one more than once.
