Hey! üëãüèº You've somehow found your way to my small corner of the internet. Hooray!

I'm a software engineer and artist. Here you'll find a mix of writing and art ‚Äì
links to music I've put into the world, ramblings on books I've read, notes
on different film processes I've experimented with and corresponding photos, etc.

My perspectives are undoubtedly framed by my experiences being mixed-race,
transgender, part of the Chinese-Malaysia diaspora, and brought up in a lot of different
places, from Knoxville, Tennessee to Singapore and many in between.

In art & life, I think often of masculinity/femininity, queerness, "home", cultural legacies & practices, relationships, and boundaries.

I like to [make][makzai-music] [music][ql-music] / take [photos][photos] /
write [essays][essays] / make
[things on the internet][things].

I love being an introvert, and a virgo, and can usually be found in Oakland, CA.
